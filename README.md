# VGSR Entity #

Structured organization and presentation of VGSR entities.

## Description ##

> This WordPress plugin requires at least [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) 4.6 and [VGSR](https://github.com/vgsr/vgsr/) 0.1.

The following entities are setup with their structured details:

1. Bestuur - Logo, season year, positions with users or names
2. Dispuut - Logo, since date, ceased date
3. Kast - Logo, address, since date, ceased date

A coupling with BuddyPress enables you to associate members with Disputen and Kasten. In the respective settings page you can select the profile field which holds the post ID by which to match the post type item with the members.

### Theme compatibility ###

This plugin is developed with no particular design in mind, so the entities should fit nicely in any theme. Themes can support this plugin by adding the necessary style adjustments in their theme's `style.css` file.

## Installation ##
